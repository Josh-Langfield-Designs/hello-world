# hello-world
My first repository

I have 12 years experience designing and developing responsive websites remotely, from the ground up and from Photoshop and Illustrator prototypes. I would say that I am at a Senior level with HTML, CSS, Photoshop, Dreamweaver and the Foundation framework, and Intermediate with JavaScript, jQuery and PHP.
